C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.
Clearly, I reject the view that there is one way that is right for everyone and for every problem.
After all, C++ isn't a perfect match for Java's design aims either.
Certainly not every good program is object-oriented, and not every object-oriented program is good.
The standard library saves programmers from having to reinvent the wheel.
Thus, the standard library will serve as both a tool and as a teacher.
